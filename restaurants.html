	<h3>-Rare</h3>
		<p> Rare is definitely the best steakhouse in Madison! The steak is perfectly cooked every time, and they have many delicious sides to choose from. The best part of the meal though, is dessert! Their chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream is to die for!</p>

	<h3>-Ian's</h3>
		<p> Ian's is the most iconic pizza place in Madison. They have so many different and unique types of pizza, as well as a build your own salad bar. My favorite slices are the Mac&Cheese, Drunken Ravioli, and Smokey the Bandit. They also have great bread sticks. Ian's is super convenient for a quick dinner pick up when you don't have too much time! </p>
